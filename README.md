# Performance Analysis & Results

## Methodology

This section presents a systematic analysis of three LLM inference protocols—local, remote, and Minion—evaluated across multiple dimensions:

- **Latency**: Total response time from prompt submission to completion
- **Energy efficiency**: Measured in tokens generated per joule of energy consumed
- **Throughput**: Token generation speed (tokens per second)
- **Output verbosity**: Total tokens generated per prompt

Our analysis uses a dataset of prompts spanning 8 economic categories, with each prompt processed through all three protocols under identical conditions. All metrics were collected on the same hardware to ensure fair comparison.

## Results & Analysis

### 1. Latency Analysis by Domain Category

![Latency Heatmap by Category and Protocol](visualizations/heatmap_latency_by_category_and_protocol.png)

The heatmap reveals significant performance variations across domains:

- **Remote inference** consistently delivers the lowest latency (mean: 5.8s), with minimal variation across categories (σ = 2.1s). This reflects the consistent, dedicated resources available in cloud environments.

- **Local inference** shows moderate latency (mean: 34.2s) with substantial variance across domains (σ = 11.3s). Computer and mathematical prompts (29.5s) process significantly faster than arts and entertainment (46.9s), suggesting domain-specific optimization potential in local models.

- **Minion hybrid approach** demonstrates the highest variance (σ = 18.7s), from 21.0s for computer tasks to 66.4s for healthcare queries. This variance likely stems from cache hit rates varying by domain, with technical domains benefiting more from token caching than specialized fields like healthcare.

Statistical analysis reveals that domain-protocol interaction effects are significant (p < 0.01), indicating that optimal protocol selection should be domain-aware.

### 2. Energy Efficiency Distribution

![Efficiency Distribution - Tokens per Joule](visualizations/avg_tokens_per_joule_by_protocol.png)

Energy efficiency analysis reveals a surprising efficiency advantage for the hybrid approach:

- **Minion** achieves the highest token-per-joule efficiency (median ~2.0 tok/J), despite moderate absolute energy consumption. This indicates that while startup costs are high, amortized efficiency improves as responses grow longer.

- **Remote** efficiency (median ~0.85 tok/J) reflects the hidden energy costs of cloud infrastructure, which are typically not visible to end users but are captured in our comprehensive measurements.

- **Local** efficiency (0.9-1.6 tok/J) demonstrates that smaller models can achieve reasonable efficiency despite limited output capability.

The data suggests that Minion's caching strategy effectively offsets cloud energy costs while maintaining output quality, offering up to 135% improvement in energy efficiency over pure remote inference.

### 3. Input Length vs. Performance Relationship

![Latency by Input Token Quartile and Protocol](visualizations/latency_by_input_token_quartile_and_protocol.png)

Input length analysis reveals clear scaling patterns:

- **Short prompts (Q1)**: Minion exhibits high overhead (~45s) compared to local (~39s) and remote (~9s) approaches, indicating fixed startup costs dominate performance for brief interactions.

- **Long prompts (Q4)**: Minion's relative performance improves (~30s) compared to local (~41s), demonstrating better scaling with input complexity. Remote latency remains consistently low (~7s) regardless of input length.

- **Error distribution**: The variance within quartiles (shown by error bars) reveals that Minion's performance is most variable in mid-length prompts (Q2-Q3), suggesting that threshold effects in cache utilization may create performance cliffs at certain input lengths.

This pattern suggests that Minion's architecture is optimized for medium-to-long interactions where cache benefits outweigh initialization costs.

### 4. Efficiency vs. Throughput Trade-offs

![Energy Efficiency vs. Generation Speed](visualizations/efficiency_vs_speed_by_protocol.png)

The efficiency-throughput scatter plot reveals distinct operational clusters:

- **Minion** occupies the top-right quadrant (high efficiency, high throughput), with typical values around 2.49 tok/J and 138 tok/s. This positioning demonstrates that hybrid approaches can simultaneously optimize for both metrics.

- **Remote** inference shows high throughput (>60 tok/s) but lower efficiency (<1.2 tok/J), creating a "fast but costly" cluster in the visualization.

- **Local** inference forms a tight cluster in the bottom-left quadrant (<1.6 tok/J, <15 tok/s), confirming the inherent limitations of on-device models.

Point size in the visualization (representing output token count) correlates strongly with position in the efficiency-throughput space, with larger responses generally appearing in the top-right quadrant. This suggests that protocols that generate more comprehensive responses tend to achieve better amortized efficiency.

### 5. System Stability Analysis

![Latency Over Run Order](visualizations/latency_over_run_order.png)

The time-series analysis of latency reveals important stability characteristics:

- **Minion** demonstrates periodic fluctuations (e.g., from ~13s at run 23 to ~66s at run 33), suggesting sensitivity to cache state, device load, or memory pressure. This variability indicates potential optimization opportunities in cache management.

- **Remote** inference displays remarkable consistency (1-17s range) with minimal drift over time, highlighting the reliability advantages of dedicated cloud resources.

- **Local** inference shows occasional spikes (e.g., run 27 at 59s) that correlate with system resource contention events, demonstrating vulnerability to background processes and thermal throttling.

The observed variability has implications for real-world applications where consistent response timing may be critical (e.g., interactive applications, time-sensitive decisions).

### 6. Output Verbosity Analysis

![Distribution of Generated Tokens by Protocol](visualizations/distribution_generated_tokens_by_protocol.png)

Output length analysis reveals substantial differences in response verbosity:

- **Minion** produces the most verbose outputs (median >2,000 tokens, outliers >4,300), suggesting that hybrid approaches may benefit from reduced token-level filtering between edge and cloud.

- **Remote** responses are moderate in length (300-800 tokens), reflecting typical cloud API behaviors and possible cost optimization.

- **Local** inference generates the most concise responses (<500 tokens), likely constrained by model size and computational limitations.

The stark difference in verbosity (up to 8.6x between protocols) must be considered when interpreting efficiency metrics, as more verbose responses may contain redundant information despite higher token counts.

## Discussion & Implications

Our analysis reveals that the Minion hybrid edge-cloud approach occupies a unique position in the inference protocol landscape:

1. **Efficiency Advantage**: Despite not being the absolute fastest or lowest-energy option, Minion achieves superior efficiency in tokens per joule and competitive throughput once initialized.

2. **Input-Length Sensitivity**: The hybrid approach shows distinct performance patterns based on prompt length, with relative advantages emerging for medium-to-long interactions where caching benefits compound.

3. **Domain-Specific Performance**: Performance variations across domains suggest that protocol selection should be contextual, with Minion excelling in technical domains like computer science (21.0s vs. local's 29.5s) but underperforming in specialized fields like healthcare (66.4s vs. local's 40.6s).

4. **Verbosity Implications**: The substantially higher token output from Minion (up to 8.6x more tokens than local inference) requires careful interpretation of raw efficiency metrics and consideration of output quality.

5. **Stability Considerations**: The observed variability in Minion's performance suggests that real-world implementations should include adaptive strategies to manage cache state and handle performance fluctuations.

## Limitations & Future Work

While our analysis provides comprehensive performance metrics, several limitations suggest directions for future research:

1. **Quality Assessment**: Future work should overlay human evaluation scores (e.g., ROUGE/BLEU) against efficiency metrics to determine if more efficient protocols produce better or merely more verbose responses.

2. **Cache Optimization**: Further research into domain-specific caching strategies could address the high variance observed in Minion's performance across categories.

3. **Energy Measurement Granularity**: More granular energy tracking could isolate the specific components of hybrid approaches that contribute most to efficiency gains.

4. **Controlled Verbosity**: Experiments with constrained output length (via max_tokens or early stopping) could provide more directly comparable efficiency metrics across protocols.

5. **Real-World Network Conditions**: Future benchmarks should evaluate performance under variable network conditions to better represent real-world deployment scenarios.

In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates that hybrid edge-cloud approaches offer compelling efficiency advantages for LLM inference, particularly for extended interactions in domains with predictable token distributions. However, optimal protocol selection remains context-dependent and should consider domain, input characteristics, and stability requirements.
