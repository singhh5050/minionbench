Identify the coefficients: Recognize the coefficients a, b, and c in the standard form of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. This is important because these coefficients are used in the quadratic formula to find the roots of the equation.\\n\\n2. Apply the quadratic formula: Use the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a) to find the roots of the equation. This step is crucial as it provides the solution to the quadratic equation.\\n\\n3. Calculate the discriminant: Compute the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) to determine the nature of the roots.
