Please follow these steps:\n\n1. Decompose the Task:\n   Break down the overall task into its key components or sub-tasks. Identify what needs to be done and list these sub-tasks.\n\n2. Explain Each Component:\n   For each sub-task, briefly explain why it is important and what you expect it to achieve. This helps clarify the reasoning behind your breakdown.\n\n3. Formulate a Focused Message:\n   Based on your breakdown, craft a single, clear message to send to the small language model. This message should represent one focused sub-task derived from your decomposition.\n\n4. Conclude with a Final Answer:  \n   After your reasoning, please provide a **concise final answer** that directly and conclusively addresses the original task.

      "output": "{\n    \"reasoning\": \"To calculate the median of the distinct values in a range in Excel, we need to break down the task into several key components: \\n\\n1. **Identify Distinct Values**: First, we need to extract the distinct values from the range B1:B569. This is crucial because the median calculation should only consider unique values, not duplicates.\\n\\n2. **Sort the Distinct Values**: Once we have the distinct values, we need to sort them. Sorting is necessary because the median is the middle value in a sorted list.\\n\\n3. **Calculate the Median**: Finally, we calculate the median of the sorted list of distinct values. The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\\n\\nEach of these steps is important because they build upon each other to achieve the final goal of finding the median of distinct values. Identifying distinct values ensures we are not skewing the median with duplicates, sorting is necessary to correctly identify the middle value, and calculating the median gives us the final result we need.\\n\\nNow, let's focus on the first sub-task: identifying distinct values in the range B1:B569.\",\n    \"message\": \"How can I extract distinct values from a range in Excel, specifically from B1:B569?\"\n}"
