This can be broken down into the following sub-tasks: \\n   a. Define 'good papers': Determine the criteria for what makes a paper 'good' in the context of automatic sleep arousal detection. \\n   b. Identify key topics: Understand the main topics or areas within automatic sleep arousal detection that are relevant. \\n   c. Search for papers: Use the criteria and topics to search for relevant academic papers. \\n\\n2. Explain Each Component: \\n   a. Define 'good papers': This is important because it sets the standard for what we are looking for. Good papers might be those that are highly cited, published in reputable journals, or have made significant contributions to the field. \\n   b. Identify key topics: Knowing the key topics helps in narrowing down the search to papers that are most relevant to the specific area of interest within automatic sleep arousal detection. \\n   c. Search for papers: This is the action step where we apply the criteria and topics to find the actual papers. \\n\\n3. Formulate a Focused Message: Based on the breakdown, the first step is to define what makes a paper 'good'. Therefore, the message to the small language model should focus on identifying criteria for good papers in the context of automatic sleep arousal detection.\",\n    \"message\": \"What criteria should be used to determine if a paper on automatic sleep arousal detection is considered 'good'?\"\n}"
