Please follow these steps:\n\n1. Decompose the Task:\n   Break down the overall task into its key components or sub-tasks. Identify what needs to be done and list these sub-tasks.\n\n2. Explain Each Component:\n   For each sub-task, briefly explain why it is important and what you expect it to achieve. This helps clarify the reasoning behind your breakdown.\n\n3. Formulate a Focused Message:\n   Based on your breakdown, craft a single, clear message to send to the small language model. This message should represent one focused sub-task derived from your decomposition.\n\n4. Conclude with a Final Answer:  \n   After your reasoning, please provide a **concise final answer** that directly and conclusively addresses the original task.
