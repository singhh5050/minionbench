      "output": "1. Single Sample T-Test: This statistical test is used to determine if a sample mean differs significantly from a known or hypothesized population mean. Use cases include testing whether the average lifetime of a new product meets a certain standard, or if a treatment has an effect compared to a control group where the control's mean is known.\n\n2. Paired T-Test: This test compares the means of two related samples (e.g., pre- and post-treatment measurements on the same individuals). It is used when there is a natural pairing between observations, such as comparing the effectiveness of a drug before and after treatment or assessing the impact of a training program on employee performance.\n\n3. Independent T-Test: This test compares the means of two independent samples (e.g., males vs. females or treatment group A vs. treatment group B). It is used when there is no inherent relationship between the observations, such as comparing the average height of male and female students in a school or testing the effectiveness of two different drugs on separate groups of patients.\n\n4. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): ANOVA is a statistical method for comparing the means of three or more groups to determine if there are significant differences among them. It is used when you have more than two independent groups, such as comparing the effectiveness of multiple drugs on different patient populations or assessing the impact of various teaching methods in an educational setting.\n\n5. Regression: Regression analysis is a statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (outcome) and one or more independent variables (predictors). It can be used to make predictions, understand causality, and identify trends or patterns in data. For example, regression might be employed to predict house prices based on factors like location, size, and number of bedrooms, or to examine the relationship between income and education level.",
