Explain Each Component:\n   For each sub-task, briefly explain why it is important and what you expect it to achieve. This helps clarify the reasoning behind your breakdown.\n\n3. Formulate a Focused Message:\n   Based on your breakdown, craft a single, clear message to send to the small language model. This message should represent one focused sub-task derived from your decomposition.\n\n4. Conclude with a Final Answer:  \n   After your reasoning, please provide a **concise final answer** that directly and conclusively addresses the original task.

Explain Each Component:\\n   - Identify the relevant tables and columns: We need to use the 'departments' table to find the department ID for 'Computer Science' and the 'students' table to find students associated with that department ID. This is crucial because it allows us to filter the students based on their department.\\n   - Determine the relationship between the tables: The 'students' table has a 'did' column that corresponds to the 'id' column in the 'departments' table. This relationship is important for joining the tables correctly.\\n   - Formulate the SQL query: Using the identified relationship, we can write a SQL query that joins the two tables and filters the results to only include students from the 'Computer Science' department.\\n\\n3. Formulate a Focused Message:\\n   - The message should ask the small language model to provide the SQL query that joins the 'students' and 'departments' tables and filters for students in the 'Computer Science' department.\\n\\n4.
