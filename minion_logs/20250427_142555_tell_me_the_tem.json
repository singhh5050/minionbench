Please follow these steps:\n\n1. Decompose the Task:\n   Break down the overall task into its key components or sub-tasks. Identify what needs to be done and list these sub-tasks.\n\n2. Explain Each Component:\n   For each sub-task, briefly explain why it is important and what you expect it to achieve. This helps clarify the reasoning behind your breakdown.\n\n3. Formulate a Focused Message:\n   Based on your breakdown, craft a single, clear message to send to the small language model. This message should represent one focused sub-task derived from your decomposition.\n\n4. Conclude with a Final Answer:  \n   After your reasoning, please provide a **concise final answer** that directly and conclusively addresses the original task.

Explain Each Component: \\n   - Temperature in Celsius: Essential for understanding the thermal conditions suitable for seed germination.\\n   - Hydrometry rate in percentage: Indicates the moisture content in the air, which affects seed germination and growth.\\n   - Sunshine rate in hours: Determines the amount of sunlight exposure, crucial for photosynthesis.\\n   - Rainfall in mm: Provides information on water availability, which is vital for seed germination and plant growth.\\n   - Humidity rate in percentage: Affects transpiration and water uptake in plants.\\n   - Soil type: Influences nutrient availability and water retention, impacting seed germination and plant health.\\n   - Type of climate: Provides a general overview of the environmental conditions where the plant thrives.\\n\\n3. Formulate a Focused Message: To gather accurate information, we should ask the small language model for each component separately. For this step, we will focus on the temperature in Celsius.\\n\\n4.
